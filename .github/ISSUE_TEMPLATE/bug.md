## Expected result


## Actual result


## Environment

 * Platform (OS): 
 * Version of Firefox: <!-- put exact version like "63.0" instead of "latest", because there are multiple  "latest" versions for each "release", "beta" and "nightly" edition. -->
 * Version (or revision) of Tree Style Tab: <!-- put exact version like "2.6.6" instead of "latest", because the "latest" version will change day by day. -->
